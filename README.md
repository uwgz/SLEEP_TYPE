# Circadian Rhythm Questionnaire

This repository contains a series of questions designed to help individuals understand their circadian preferences, specifically whether they are more morning or evening oriented. These questions are based on a measure of morningness and can provide a general idea of how one's circadian rhythm compares against others.

## Overview

The questions are structured to assess personal preferences and habits related to sleep and wakefulness patterns. By answering these questions, individuals can gain insights into their circadian rhythms, which may help in planning daily activities according to their natural tendencies for alertness and sleep.

## Question Format

The questions are presented in a specific format, including the question text, multiple choice options, and scoring instructions. Users are encouraged to answer all questions honestly based on their own experiences and preferences.

Example:
```python
questions_and_options = [
    # Example question format
    ("Question text here",
     {1: "Option 1 (score)", 2: "Option 2 (score)", ...},
     {1: scoreValue1, 2: scoreValue2, ...}),
    # Additional questions follow the same format
]

## Disclaimer
Note: This questionnaire is not a diagnostic tool. The results should only be interpreted as a general idea of how you compare against the rest of the audience. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for any concerns regarding your sleep patterns or health.
